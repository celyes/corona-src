### Corona virus live statistics and heatmap in Algeria

realtime corona virus (COVID-19) tracking in Algeria

### Introduction

if you've been following the corona virus (COVID-19) news in Algeria, you'll notice the wide spread of fake news about it, and that's why I coded this website. it has a simple and intuitive interface that conveys the purpose which is informing the visitor about the exat and official number of cases in the country.

the website is Arabic and the reason is obvious...it's the main language of the country.
